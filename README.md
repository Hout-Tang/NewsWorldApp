Project initial design
1) A title : 

The title of the app is NewsWorld App

2) Description of topic, problems to be addressed and goals of the projects :

One of the main problem which our team want to solve is the spread of fake news in the society. We believe that we could solve this issue by creating trustworthy news application. We use NewsAPI which allows us to fetch the most recent news from the most trusted news media companies around the world.

3) A brief “vision” of the user experience:

For our NewsWorld App, the users can choose their preferable news categories which are listed on the app such as Sports news, Tech news, Business news, etc. Moreover, after reading any specific article, the user can then like/dislike an article and/or comment on that article and also share the article to their friends and family. In order to share the article, they have to either connect a social media account to our app, or they can create an account in our app. Lastly, we will have a chatting feature for our users to connect with their fellow news readers, they can chat, share articles, share pictures just like any other social media apps.

4) A high-level design:

We used Figma(web-drawn user interface) to design for our app's layout.
(The link to Figma is https://www.figma.com/file/cONnOACWt4jMn0u1Q2zuOu/Proposal-App-Layout?node-id=0%3A1)
We have 6 main layouts and many different small layouts for each main layouts. We will add more layouts here as our project proceeds.

We have accounts settings where users can edit their profiles/change password/privacy&security. We have text size where users can change the text font size either small/medium/big. Lastly, we have term of service for our app and app feedback where users can submit any problems related to the app.
